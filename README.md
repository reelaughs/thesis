A research study utilising regression to study changes in attitude certainty arising from interactions involving the individual trait of defensive confidence

This study aims to examine how the individual trait of defensive confidence will interact with attitudinal bases and message type (affect-cognition matching) to affect change in attitude certainty after being presented with a persuasive attack. 
The study design was a defensive confidence (continuous, high vs low) x message type (affective vs cognitive) x individual differences in structural bases (affective v. cognitive) between-subject design. 
The current study hypothesised a larger change in attitude certainty, specifically an increase in certainty, for individuals with low as compared to high defensive confidence. 
Results supported previous research findings on the effects of defensive confidence on attitude certainty as hypothesised, but a matching effect was not established, which holds implications for the means of experimental manipulation for future research seeking to successfully establish matching effects involving individual structural bases. Further research is required to investigate the interacting effects of matching and defensive confidence and tease apart the numerous variables and mechanisms involved in evoking a change in attitude certainty.
